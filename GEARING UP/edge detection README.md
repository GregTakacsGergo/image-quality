**So what is edge detection?**

The primary goal of this step 
Edge detection is a technique used to identify the boundaries of objects in an image. It is a fundamental step in many image processing tasks such as object recognition, object tracking, and image segmentation.

Let’s start by defining an example function \( f(x, y) \), where \( f(x, y) \) represents the intensity at each pixel \((x, y)\). In a real image, \( f(x, y) \) would come from actual pixel values, but let’s create a small, simple example to illustrate how \( f(x, y) \) and its derivatives work.

### Example Function \( f(x, y) \)

Imagine a small 5x5 grayscale image where \( f(x, y) \) contains pixel intensity values from 0 to 255. Here’s a hypothetical intensity matrix for this image:

```python
[
    [50, 50, 80, 50, 10],
    [50, 100, 150, 100, 50],
    [80, 150, 200, 150, 80],
    [50, 100, 150, 100, 50],
    [10, 50, 80, 50, 10]
]
```

\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} X \\\ Y \end{bmatrix}

In this matrix:
- \( f(0, 0) = 10 \) is the intensity at the top-left corner.
- \( f(2, 2) = 200 \) is the intensity at the center, which is the highest value in this example, indicating a bright spot.

### Calculating the First Derivative

To approximate the first derivative, we’ll calculate the intensity changes in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions. In practice, we do this using convolution with specific operators like the Sobel operator, which gives us \( G_x \) and \( G_y \), representing the rate of intensity change across \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.



1. **Defining the Image**: `f` represents the intensity values for our 5x5 sample "image."
2. **Computing \( G_x \) and \( G_y \)**:
   - `cv2.Sobel(f, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)` computes the gradient in the x-direction (horizontal changes).
   - `cv2.Sobel(f, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)` computes the gradient in the y-direction (vertical changes).
3. **Calculating the Gradient Magnitude**:
   - We calculate \( |\nabla f| = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2} \), giving us the edge strength at each point in the image.
   
### Result Interpretation
- **Original Intensity Matrix \( f(x, y) \)**: Shows the initial intensity values.
- **\( G_x \) and \( G_y \)**: Highlight changes in intensity horizontally and vertically.
- **Gradient Magnitude**: Shows the strength of edges, which are highest where intensity changes rapidly (edges of bright areas).

This approach, used on real images, will provide a detailed edge map, allowing us to locate edges or regions with high-frequency detail effectively.
