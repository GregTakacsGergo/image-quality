**Image Quality Checker**

This program is used to check the quality of an image. It uses opencv-python library to perform image processing. The program takes an input image and calculates de laplacian variance (second derivative) of the image, which highlights regions of high intensity change. The program then calculates the mean and standard deviation of the laplacian variance values, which gives an idea of the overall quality of the image.
